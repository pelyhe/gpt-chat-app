Chris Drange is a German contemporary artist who is best known for his large-format post-digital portraits and realist oil paintings of modern-day influencers and social media symbols. He was born in 1983 in Köthen (Anhalt), Germany and studied at the International Center of Photography and the Art Students League of New York. He also holds a bachelor’s and a master’s degree in fine arts from the University of Fine Arts in Hamburg.

He has published two photobooks, Hecho en Socialismo and Relics, and has exhibited at various museums and galleries such as the Whitechapel Gallery, London, the Nasher Sculpture Center, Dallas, the UCCA Center for Contemporary Art, Beijing, and the Galerie König, Berlin.

Users are customers of galleries, who are interested in art. Users can be categorized into 3 categories: impulsive, thematic, investor. Users who go to auctions are investors. Users who don't have any favourite artists are investors. Users who go to art fairs are not investors. If the user is not an investor, then we should check if s/he likes only one certain type of artwork. There are a few types of artworks, such as: paintings, photography, sculptures, architecture, cinema. If the user is interested in one certain type of artworks, then s/he has to be a thematic user. For example if a user is only interested in paintings, but nothing else, s/he is a thematic user. If the user is interested in more than only type of artworks, then s/he is an impulsive user. For example, if a user likes paintings and photography as well, s/he is an impulsive user.
